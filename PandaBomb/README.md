# The main directory for the game 
pls upload the fpga codes in the *source* folder

# TODOs:
- debug joystick_input and orientation_unit -> control_unit.direction(input)
- ~~add in external button inputs(start,reset,direction x4)~~ we use io_button and io_dip
- add in led for displaying UP direction
- ~~add in timer 60sec(not implementable since button detector not compatible with slowclock)~~
- ~~add in 7-seg to show the remaining time(same as above)~~
